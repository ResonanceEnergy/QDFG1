# Scene + Resolution System

A **Scene** is a situation with:
- narrative text
- choices (some conditional)
- resolution (direct or skill check)
- immediate effects (time/fatigue/health/log)
- hidden long‑term effects (flags)

**Rule:** Failure moves forward. It changes the situation instead of ending the game.
