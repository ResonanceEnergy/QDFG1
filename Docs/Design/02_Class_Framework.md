# Class Framework (QFG1‑style)

Three asymmetric archetypes (original names; functional equivalents):

- **Vanguard** — force, endurance, direct intervention
- **Arcanist** — preparation, insight, warding
- **Shade** — stealth, timing, avoidance

**Rule:** Every meaningful situation supports at least **2** valid approaches, ideally **3**.
